Assuming Docker is installed

1. Go to the directory where the Dockerfile is present
2. In terminal type "docker build -t blocknetdx ."
3. Next type 'docker run -it -v "<absolute path of directory in local machine>: <absolute path of directory in docker image>" blocknetdx' (This will open an interactive terminal)
4. In the terminal, type blocknetdxd to start node
